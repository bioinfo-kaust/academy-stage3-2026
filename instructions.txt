Dear Claude,

I need your help to create a GitHub webpage for a Bioinformatics Specialization Program. The program information is provided in the `program-info.txt` file, which outlines the learning outcomes, practical information, and a detailed daily schedule with topics and activities, including specific labs.

Please create a clean, modern, and user-friendly static website. Here are the key requirements:

**Website Structure:**

*   **Home Page:**
    *   Should provide a general overview of the Bioinformatics Specialization Program.
    *   Include "Program Learning Outcomes" and "Practical Information" from `program-info.txt`.
    *   Possibly link to the daily schedule and lab pages.

*   **Program Schedule Page:**
    *   A dedicated page presenting the "Time", "Session", and "Topics & Activities" for each day (Day 1 to Day 4) as detailed in `program-info.txt`.
    *   This should be easily readable and well-formatted.
    *   currently the slide ppt files are empty but we will replace the files later, so you can use this names to link them to the pages.

*   **Labs Page (Main):**
    *   A main page that lists all the labs.
    *   Each lab entry should link to a separate, dedicated lab page.

*   **Separate Lab Pages:**
    *   Create a separate page for each lab (e.g., `lab1.html`, `lab2.html`, etc.).
    *   Each lab page should include:
        *   **Lab Title:** (e.g., L1: Warm-up for Large-scale Analysis & Genomic File Formats)
        *   **Description:** A more detailed explanation of the lab's purpose and objectives, drawing from the "Topics & Activities" and "Program Outline" sections in `program-info.txt`.
        *   **Example Details/Instructions:** Provide step-by-step instructions with example commands or code snippets. I've provided an example for the first lab below, please create similar detailed examples for all other labs based on the `program-info.txt` content. Also, try to find relevant datasets for the lab. you could use the same dataset throughout the prgram from preproessing to gene differential and enrichment analysis.

        **Example for L1: Warm-up for Large-scale Analysis & Genomic File Formats (Day 1)**

        **Objective:** Familiarize with the training environment, access public genomics resources, and download example RNA-seq datasets.

        **Instructions:**

        1.  **Log in to the training environment:**
            ```bash
            ssh user@training_server_ip
            ```
            *(Replace `user` and `training_server_ip` with actual credentials/IP provided during the course setup.)*

        2.  **Navigate to your working directory:**
            ```bash
            cd /data/my_project/rna_seq
            ```
            *(Create this directory if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p /data/my_project/rna_seq`)*

        3.  **Access public genomics resources:**
            We will use the NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) for downloading data. You can browse it at [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

        4.  **Download example RNA-seq datasets:**
            For this lab, we will download a small subset of reads for an example RNA-seq experiment using `prefetch` and `fastq-dump` from the SRA Toolkit.

            *   **Identify an SRA Accession:** Let's assume we are interested in a dataset with accession `SRR1234567`.
            *   **Download with `prefetch` (optional, but good practice):**
                ```bash
                prefetch SRR1234567
                ```
                This downloads the SRA file into `~/ncbi/public/sra/`.

            *   **Convert SRA to FASTQ:**
                ```bash
                fastq-dump --split-files SRR1234567 -O .
                ```
                This will create `SRR1234567_1.fastq` and `SRR1234567_2.fastq` in your current directory.
                *(If single-end data, it will be `SRR1234567.fastq`)*

            *   **Inspect the downloaded files:**
                ```bash
                ls -lh SRR1234567_*.fastq
                head -n 8 SRR1234567_1.fastq
                ```
                This will show you the file sizes and the first few reads of the FASTQ file.

*   **Environment Setup Page:**
    *   A dedicated page for setting up the bioinformatics environment.
    *   Include instructions for:
        *   **Linux Setup:** Basic command-line environment setup (e.g., common utilities, text editors like `nano` or `vim`, `wget`, `curl`).
        *   **Conda Setup:** Detailed instructions on installing Miniconda/Anaconda and creating/managing Conda environments for bioinformatics tools.

        **Example for Conda Setup:**

        **Objective:** Set up a robust and reproducible bioinformatics environment using Conda.

        **Instructions:**

        1.  **Download Miniconda:**
            Navigate to your home directory and download the Miniconda installer.
            ```bash
            cd ~
            wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
            ```
            *(Ensure you get the latest version suitable for your system from the official Miniconda website if this link is outdated.)*

        2.  **Install Miniconda:**
            Run the installer. Follow the prompts, accepting the license agreement and choosing the default installation location (`~/miniconda3`).
            ```bash
            bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
            ```
            When prompted "Do you wish to run `conda init`?", type `yes`.

        3.  **Initialize Conda and restart your shell:**
            Close and reopen your terminal, or source your `.bashrc` (or equivalent) file:
            ```bash
            source ~/.bashrc
            ```
            You should now see `(base)` in your terminal prompt.

        4.  **Update Conda:**
            ```bash
            conda update -n base -c defaults conda
            ```

        5.  **Create a Bioinformatics environment:**
            It's good practice to create separate environments for different projects or toolsets.
            ```bash
            conda create -n bioinformatics_course python=3.9
            ```
            *(You can specify other tools to install directly here, e.g., `conda create -n bioinformatics_course python=3.9 fastqc multiqc`)*

        6.  **Activate the environment:**
            ```bash
            conda activate bioinformatics_course
            ```
            Your prompt should now change to `(bioinformatics_course)`.

        7.  **Install common bioinformatics tools:**
            We will use `bioconda` channel for most bioinformatics tools. Add it to your channels with high priority.
            ```bash
            conda config --add channels conda-forge
            conda config --add channels bioconda
            conda config --set channel_priority strict
            ```
            Now install some essential tools:
            ```bash
            conda install -c bioconda fastqc samtools star deseq2 r-base
            ```
            *(This is an example; please refer to the course curriculum for the exact list of tools.)*

        8.  **Deactivate the environment when done:**
            ```bash
            conda deactivate
            ```

**General Requirements:**

* Use responsive design.
* Ensure clear navigation between pages.
* Maintain a consistent and professional aesthetic.
* Keep language student-friendly and instructional
* Assume students have little computational background
* Use code blocks, command examples, and step-by-step explanations

Please ask if you need any clarification or further details.
